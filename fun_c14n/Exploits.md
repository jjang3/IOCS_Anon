# Exploits

## DARPA CGC
> https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge
> https://github.com/GrammaTech/cgc-cbs
> Tested both `cqe-challenges` and `examples` in the repository provided above. `cqe-challenges` contains challenge binaries (CBs) from the CGC qualifying event (cqe), whereas `eamples` contains CB samples and challenge final events (cfe) challenges.

- Findings:
  - The purpose of this event was primarily to create a program to automatically 1) detect the vulnerability; and 2) patch the vulnerability to mitigate flaws.

- Results:
  - From going through the testing and trying out different test cases, it seems unfit for our testing purpose in the case of adversarial analysis because there is no actual "exploit" which occurs through these binaries. 
  - This is primarily targeted to test bug detection + patching, whereas our purpose is to figure out the test case where we can demonstrate attack before and after isolation.
  - Possible use-case of these binaries could be to test our iteration #2? (to explore uncharted path), I will still need to figure out how to hook taint analysis to these binaries (need some research)

## min-dop
> https://github.com/mayanez/min-dop
> Tested `min-dop` before and after isolation; result looks promising as this example showcases what we were targeting: attacks across the isolation.

- Findings: 

## Sudo (CVE-2021-3156)
